**Functional Programming:**
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming.

**Key Features of Functional Programming:**

1. **Immutability:**
   - Data, once created, cannot be changed.
   - Immutability simplifies reasoning about program state.

2. **Pure Functions:**
   - A function's output is determined solely by its input, with no observable side effects.
   - Pure functions are easier to test, reason about, and parallelize.

3. **First-Class Functions:**
   - Functions are first-class citizens; they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

4. **Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
   - Promotes code reuse and abstraction.

5. **Referential Transparency:**
   - An expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior.
   - Enabled by pure functions.

6. **Declarative Style:**
   - Emphasizes what should be achieved over how to achieve it.
   - Expresses logic without explicitly describing control flow.

7. **Recursion:**
   - Loops are replaced with recursive functions.
   - Tail recursion is often used to optimize recursion.

**Where Functional Programming is Used:**
- **Web Development:** Functional programming is used in both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (React, Angular) development.
- **Data Processing:** Functional programming is well-suited for data manipulation and processing tasks.
- **Concurrency:** It is beneficial for concurrent and parallel programming due to immutability and lack of shared state.
- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs):** Functional programming concepts are often employed in DSLs for specific problem domains.
- **Big Data and Analytics:** Functional programming is popular in big data processing and analytics tasks.

**Languages That Implement Functional Programming:**
- **Haskell:** A purely functional programming language.
- **Scala:** Combines functional and object-oriented programming.
- **Clojure:** A functional Lisp dialect.
- **Erlang:** Designed for concurrent and distributed systems.
- **JavaScript:** While not purely functional, JavaScript supports functional programming concepts.

**Functional Programming in JavaScript (with Code Samples):**

1. **Immutability:**
   ```javascript
   // Using spread operator for immutability
   const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
   const newArray = [...originalArray, 4];
   ```

2. **Pure Functions:**
   ```javascript
   // Pure function
   function add(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   }
   ```

3. **Higher-Order Functions:**
   ```javascript
   // Higher-order function
   function multiplyBy(factor) {
     return function (number) {
       return number * factor;
     };
   }
   ```

4. **Declarative Style:**
   ```javascript
   // Imperative vs Declarative
   // Imperative
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   const squared = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
     squared.push(numbers[i] * numbers[i]);
   }
   // Declarative
   const squared = numbers.map((number) => number * number);
   ```

5. **Recursion:**
   ```javascript
   // Recursive function
   function factorial(n) {
     return n === 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
   ```

**JavaScript's Approach to Functional Programming:**
JavaScript supports functional programming concepts, but it's not purely functional. It has first-class functions, higher-order functions, and allows a functional programming style. Libraries like lodash and Ramda provide utility functions that align with functional programming principles. Additionally, ES6 introduced features like arrow functions and the spread/rest operator, making functional programming more convenient in JavaScript.

  Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative type of programming style that focuses on what to solve rather than how to solve (which is often found in imperative style of programming). 

Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus.

**Key Features of Functional Programming:**

1. **Pure Functions:** The output of a pure function is solely determined by its input and it has no side effects (i.e., it does not modify any states).

2. **Immutability:** In functional programming, state and data are immutable, meaning that they can't be changed after they're created. This helps to avoid side effects and makes your code more predictable.

3. **First-Class Functions:** Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.

4. **Higher-Order Functions:** These are functions that can take one or more functions as arguments, return a function as a result or both. This property allows for functions to be composed together in interesting ways.

5. **Recursion:** Since functional programming discourages the use of looping constructs (like for-loops or while-loops), recursion is often used as a substitute.

**Functional Programming in JavaScript:**

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it supports programming in many different styles. Other than functional programming, JavaScript also supports procedural and object-oriented programming. Here's an example of functional programming in JavaScript:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// map is a higher order function provided by JavaScript
const square = array.map(x => x * x);

console.log(square); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Functional Programming with JavaScript Libraries:**

There are several popular JavaScript libraries that make it easier to follow functional programming principles in JavaScript:

1. **Lodash.js**: Lodash is a utility library that provides helpful methods for manipulation and combination of arrays, objects, and other data types.

```javascript
import _ from 'lodash';

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled = _.map(array, x => x * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

2. **Ramda.js**: Ramda provides a set of utility functions for working with JavaScript in a functional way, without changing the original data.

```javascript
import R from 'ramda';

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let doubled = R.map(x => x * 2, array);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

3. **Immutable.js**: Immutable.js provides several data structures that encourage immutability, which is a core concept in functional programming [Source 0](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript-explained-in-plain-english/), [Source 3](https://betterprogramming.pub/functional-programming-in-javascript-introduction-and-practical-examples-d268e44395b2), [Source 4](https://github.com/readme/guides/functional-programming-basics), [Source 5](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/functional-programming-javascript), [Source 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 7](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript-for-beginners/), [Source 8](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript).

  In addition to the basic functional programming concepts, there are several more advanced concepts that can be useful when writing functional code in JavaScript:

1. **Currying:** Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. Currying can make your code easier to read and write. Here's an example of currying:

```javascript
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;

const multiplyByTwo = multiply(2);
console.log(multiplyByTwo(3)); // Output: 6
```

In this example, the `multiply` function is curried. It takes one argument `a`, and returns a new function that takes one argument `b`. This allows you to create new functions like `multiplyByTwo` by providing some of the arguments to the `multiply` function [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/currying-in-javascript/).

2. **Partial Application:** Partial application is a technique in which you fix a number of arguments to a function, creating another function of smaller arity. Here's an example:

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);

console.log(double(3)); // Output: 6
```

In this example, the `double` function is created by partially applying the `multiply` function with the argument `2` [Source 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/).

3. **Composition:** Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Composing functions together is a fundamental concept in functional programming. Here's an example:

```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => (x) => f(g(x));

const square = (x) => x * x;
const double = (x) => x + x;

const squareOfDouble = compose(square, double);

console.log(squareOfDouble(3)); // Output: 36
```

In this example, the `compose` function takes two functions `f` and `g`, and returns a new function that applies `f` to the result of `g`. The `squareOfDouble` function is created by composing the `square` and `double` functions [Source 3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/).

4. **Functors:** A functor is an object that implements a `map` method which, while running over each value in the object to produce a new object, adheres to two rules (preserve identity and composability). JavaScript array is a common example of a functor, but it doesn't have to be a collection. For example:

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(arr2); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, the `map` method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array [Source 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/).

5. **Monads:** Monads are a type of functor that also implements a `flatmap` (or `bind`) method. It's a way to handle additional concerns like not throwing an exception in the middle of a chain of function calls, keeping a chain of functions going when a value is `null`, or switching the execution context of function calls. They're a bit more advanced and can take some time to get used to.

These are some of the more advanced concepts in functional programming. Understanding them can help you write more efficient, clean, and understandable code [Source 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/currying-in-javascript/), [Source 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/), [Source 6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-programming-in-javascript/).
